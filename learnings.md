## Thoughts
PHP is pretty similar to JS on some fronts.

It does have some extra operators that are interesting.

## Notes
- <?php ?> and <? ?> are equivalent
- Variables are declared with $name
- arrays are made array('Ben', 'Tony', 'Guy')
- Comments work the same as in JS: single // or multiline /**/
- Use echo to print to screen
- You have to use break tags a lot to split up statements on to new lines
- you access content in arrays the same way as in js
- PHP is loosely typed so you get some type coercion happening

## Techniques
- There's an exponent operator for powers **
- The exclusive logical operator xor (returns true if only one value is true, but false if both values are the same i.e. both true or both false)
- Strings are concatenated using .
- Two string types. '' are string literals (e.g. all charcters presented as is, so no code are expecuted inside). "" are variable strings so you can use variables inside them.

## Mistakes
- You have to end statements with ; otherwise there will be an error
- When using the Here Docs selector <<<_END the closing syntax must start at the begining of a new line. No exceptions.
